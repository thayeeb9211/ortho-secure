# What is DevSecOps 
DevSecOps focuses on security automation, testing and enforcement during DevOps - Release - SDLC cycles. The whole meaning behind this methodology is connecting together Development, Security and Operations. DevSecOps is methodology providing different methods, techniques and processes backed mainly with tooling focusing on developer / security experience. 

DevSecOps takes care that security is part of every stage of DevOps loop - Plan, Code, Build, Test, Release, Deploy, Operate, Monitor.

   FLASK_ENV=development
   MYSQL_PORT=3306
   MYSQL_INITDB_SKIP_TZINFO=1
   SONAR_HOST_URL= "http://localhost:9000" or maybe different in your case [make sure it is reachable]
   SONAR_LOGIN= <your sonarqube login token>
   SECRET_KEY = <secret used in main.py for this project>
   MAIL_PASSWORD = <it's a mail password>


   [Make sure you create a sonar-project.properties file and add up your values in sonar-project.properties]
   sonar.projectKey=your_project_key_here
   sonar.token=your_sonar_token_here
   sonar.sources=.
   sonar.qualitygate.wait=true
   sonar.host.url=http://your_sonar_host_url_here
   sonar.python.version=your_python_version_here

   ```
3. Start the application on Docker:
   ```sh
   ./execute.sh
   ```
4. Run security code scans:
   ```sh
    By Running bandit -r in the Currect directory.
   ```
4. Run SAST scans by ensuring it has sonarsacnner [properties configured]:
   ```sh
   make sure your Sonar Scanner config properties are like this -- >
     sonar.projectKey=nidith_orthosecure_03ac60c4-e7f9-4f33-b330-4f90a86cc655
     sonar.token=<your sonarqube token>
     sonar.sources=.
     sonar.qualitygate.wait=true
     sonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000/ # Use proper HTTP url
     sonar.python.version=3.11

     if u are not getting how to do it, you can read the PHASE 4 Document in the Reports/ folder
   
    For a SAST Security check run sonar-scanner in the root directory.
   ```
